#   OK to edit this directly or use Birdland 'Edit->Settings'.

#   User expansion '~/' is supported for some settings.

#   Some settings accept one or more values. Surround multiple values               
#   with three single quotes starting on the line of first item and ending
#   on the line of the last. For example, see: source_priority, 
#   audio_file_extensions, themes.

#   This includes many internal setting that are not exposed in 'Edit->Setting'.
#   Don't modify these unless you have good reason and know what you are doing
