#   WRW 7 Apr 2022 - Created this by hand editing from other lists in Book-Lists folder to bring to somewhat
#       consistent format. This is an OCD attempt to identify most of the common music books based
#       on their appearance in other book list. 

#   This was the original basis for CanonicalNames.txt but not all books here
#       were included in that and some were added to that as encountered in raw indexes.

#   Names in CanonicalNames.txt are generally the publishers name for the book with some minor
#       adjustments to resolve ambiguities and distinguish editions and publishers.
#       Publishers names are separated from the book name with a '-' shown as 'Unknown' where
#       it is not known.

#   'The' removed from most names in CanonicalNames.txt
